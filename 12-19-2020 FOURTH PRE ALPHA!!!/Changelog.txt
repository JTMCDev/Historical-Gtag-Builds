fixed the biggest perf issue on quest (the ik animations), updated the locomotion a bit, it should be harder to jam your head and hands through things though its still not impossible, moved some geo around, added another arrow in the tutorial to hopefully make the ramp a little clearer, tweaked the treehouse ladder again, made it so by default quest starts with no stick turn and pc starts with snap turn, made turning speed a little faster
